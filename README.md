# Inherent-strain-method-in-Metal-Additive-Manufacturing-Abaqus-simulation
This research investigates the application of the Inherent Strain method in Abaqus, an effective numerical strategy for simulating Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) in metal additive manufacturing. For this purpose, we have implemented the DFLUX and USDFLD subroutines using Fortran.
